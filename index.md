Hello and welcome! I am currently a research analyst at the New York Fed, where I focus on applied microeconomics. My work at the Fed covers topics ranging from land price modeling to school district finances. I attended Wesleyan University, where I wrote my thesis about the effects of teacher unionization. In all these ventures, I use a combination of Python, R, Stata, and SAS.
